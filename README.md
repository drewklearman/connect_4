# connect_4
Implemented the game Connect4 in python. Implemented the minimax algorithm (with pruning) with a sophisticated state score that plays well. Will build a functional GUI to visualize the game better. Hoping to then use the AlphaZero Algorithm to make a bot that plays optimally and can defeat the minimax algorithm at a depth of 4.
