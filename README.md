# connect_4
Implemented the game Connect4 in python. Implemented the minimax algorithm (with pruning) with a sophisticated state score that plays well. Will build a functional GUI to visualize the game better. Hoping to then use the AlphaZero Algorithm to make a bot that plays optimally and can defeat the minimax algorithm at a depth of 4.

To use, run main and select the two strategies to play against each other. The options are 'manual', 'random', 'minimax'. Try to beat the minimax algorithm on 3 layers (hard) or 4 layers (insane).
